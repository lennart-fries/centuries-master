<h2>Petrini</h2>
<p>With the arrival of Antonio Petrini and his work on the walls of Würzburg, a new style of construction was created:
Petrini mixed German Renaissance style with Italian Baroque and the Franconian Baroque style was born. He built the Stift Haug,
a church with two 60 meter tall domes, in this new style, inspired by the Dome in Rome.</p>

<h2>Cannonballs</h2>
<p>The people of Würzburg didn't trust the stability of the construction and wanted to test it. They fired a cannon inside the
church and if the domes broke down, the architect would be executed. Petrini waited for an escape signal outside Würzburg,
but the domes stayed in place, and Petrini returned to the city.</p>
