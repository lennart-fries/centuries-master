<p>Balthasar Neumann built this house on his own and was thrown out, because someone of his origin wasn't supposed to
live in such a pompous place. And so the most popular architect of the Baroque era in Würzburg had to leave his own house.</p>

<h2>Biographie</h2>
<p>Balthasar Neumann was a trained cannon and bell founder as well as a fireworks expert and went to Würzburg for work. He
started studying architecture and geometry and became engineer captain while he worked in Würzburg. While his first buildings
were unimpressive residential houses, his second big construction project was the Residence. After some finishing the Residence
under difficult conditions, he became chief-architect of Würzburg. Then a time of traveling and teaching began for Neumann.
He became an architecture teacher and tried to deepen his knowledge by traveling and learning. Additionally the royal and mighty
family Schönborn sent him all around the German empire to construct other buildings for them. Neumann died before his last project,
the Käppelle, was finished and was buried in the Marienkapelle.</p>
