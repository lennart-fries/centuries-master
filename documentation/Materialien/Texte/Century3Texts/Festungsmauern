<h2>Italians</h2>
<p>Italian architects who were specialized in fortress building were ordered to W端rzburg to create walls to make W端rzburg
impregnable. The whole city should get surrounded by high walls and in front of the walls, a so-called glacis was made.
A glacis is empty, which makes attackers unable to hide or protect themselves using the environment.</p>

<h2>Funny fact</h2>
<p>High expenses were made to built these walls and the city of W端rzburg was reconstructed heavily, but under the reign of
the prince-bishops W端rzburg was never again attacked and its walls were left useless.</p>
