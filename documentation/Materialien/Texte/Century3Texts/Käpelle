<h2>Neumann again</h2>
<p>The KÃ¤pelle was the last project Neumann started, though he didn't finish it. He died while the construction work was underway.</p>

<h2>See a light</h2>
<p>Once, a fisherman found a statue of Pieta, the Roman version of Mary, mother of Jesus, in the Main.
He brought it to the Nikolausberg and the winegrowers started praying to this Pieta.
Soon pilgrims started visiting it and the citizens built a wooden chapel after light phenomena were seen close to this area.
The prince-bishop tried to avoid the construction of a sanctuary for pilgrims, but he had to bow to the citizens and under Balthasar Neumann,
a real chapel made of stone was built.</p>
