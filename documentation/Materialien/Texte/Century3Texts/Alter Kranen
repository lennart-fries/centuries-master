<h2>Architect</h2>
<p>The son of Balthasar Neumann, Franz Ignaz Neumann takes over for his father and builds a great structure in WÃ¼rzburg: the Kranen. The prince-bishop Seinsheim wanted to increase trade on the Main so he gave orders to built this giant tool for lifting up to 1.2 tons. Inside, a large wheel can move the two arms of the crane up and down. This was very hard labour, done by only the toughest workers.</p>
