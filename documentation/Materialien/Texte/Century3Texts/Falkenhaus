<h2>Naming</h2>
<p>Formerly there were no street names, so the people had to choose different orientation points like the falcon on the Falkenhaus, which it is named after. That is how the Falkenhaus became a landmark for the people of Würzburg.</p>

<h2>Baroque</h2>
<p>Under Balthasar Neumann the whole city was reconstructed in the Baroque style and everyone who built a stone facade on their house could get tax subsidies. The owner of the Falkenhaus overdid it and created a very pompous Rococo style facade to get extra tax relief, but it was not granted.</p>

<h2>Neumann</h2>
<p>The pompous and overloaded style of the house displeased many citizens, one being Balthasar Neumann. He wrote in a letter to his son, "Such a building does not deserve a place in my Würzburg!".</p>
