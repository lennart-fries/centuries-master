<h2>Architect</h2>
<p>Balthasar Neumann built this chapel.</p>

<h2>Former use</h2>
<p>Schönborn wanted to make this chapel into a shrine for his family, but just one child from the family Schönborn who died early is buried here.</p>

<h2>Memento mori</h2>
<p>The second principle of the Baroque time is "Memento mori!", which means "remember that you have to die".
That's why the chapel was built close enough to the Residence to see it, to remind the prince-bishops that they, too, will die.</p>
