<h2>Schönborn</h2>
<p>There were 3 prince-bishops from the family Schönborn and when the Residence was built, one of them was prince-bishop of Würzburg.
They claimed that they were infested with the "building-worm", a fancy way to say that the family Schönborn had many buildings constructed.</p>

<h2>Neumann</h2>
<p>Balthasar Neumann was the architect who built the Residence, after which the family Schönborn had many buildings constructed by him.
But at the start, it seemed like Neumann would never finish the Residence. After his first client, Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn,
who gave him the commission to built the Residence at first, died, the following prince-bishop stopped the construction. 5 years after
his death, the construction work was resumed.</p>

<h2>Bossi</h2>
<p>Antonio Giuseppe Bossi was responsible for the stucco work in the Residence. The stucco at this time was made with
toxic ingredients and after finishing the white hall, a room which is almost completely made of stucco, Bossi became
mentally deranged and died soon after.</p>

<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn raised taxes to get enough money to build the Residence, but this was not his only way to fund the
construction. Gallus Jacob, Würzburg's former director of finances, was forced by Schönborn to pay a lot of money, because he had stolen
tax revenue belonging to the city. He did so to avoid a legal process.</p>

<h2>Carpe diem</h2>
<p>One of the two big principles of the Baroque period is "Carpe diem!", seize the day.</p>
