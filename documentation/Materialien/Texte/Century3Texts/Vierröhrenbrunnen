<h2>Water</h2>
<p>When Balthasar Neumann rebuilt Würzburg, he found a new source of water, which he used for his construction work on the Residence.
Later he rerouted the water here and built the "Vierröhrenbrunnen". </p>

<h2>Statues</h2>
<p>The four statues at the bottom of the well depict the four secular virtues: Fortitudo - Strength and courage; Prudentia - Wisdom;
Justitia - Justice; Temperantia - Moderation. On the top of the well we can see Frankonia, patron of the Franks, holding a sword and a banner.</p>
