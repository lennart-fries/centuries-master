<h2>Just Echter things</h2>
<p>When Julius Echter came back from a long trip where he got to know new ways of healing, he founded this hospital with his personal money. After he had the Jews thrown out of the city, he confiscated their property, which included a big graveyard. The Juliusspital was built on this graveyard and a garden for healing herbs was created there, too. Soon after wine bars were added.</p>
