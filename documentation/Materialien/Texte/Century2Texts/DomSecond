<h2>Scherenberg</h2>
<p>In the late middle ages, an old man named Scherenberg became prince-bishop of Würzburg, though not for long, it seemed: he was 65 years old, and many of the other candidates wished for his early demise, but they were disappointed. He lived to be 95 years old. In his 30 years of rule, Scherenberg had to deal with the financially difficult situation in Würzburg, so he bought back some leased properties, decreased the authority and rights of the city council for his own advantage.</p>

<h2>Bibra</h2>
<p>Prince-bishop Scherenberg was followed by Lorenz of Bibra, who was a beloved by the people of Würzburg, even though he decreased the rights of the city council even more than Scherenberg did. Under Bibra's reign, Würzburg reached its financial zenith and the Marienberg fortress was rebuilt in Renaissance style. Bibra was also the first bishop who had his tomb made before his death, and shortly before his death he apologized to the city council for acting against them.</p>

<h2>Echter</h2>
<p>Julius Echter of Mespelbrunn was elected bishop when he was 28 years old. He had the fortress rebuilt and enlarged with a bailey named after him, the "Echter Hof". In the following years he built the University of Würzburg, founded a hospital for Christians named after him, the "Juliusspital", and had the court library renovated. Echter was a great supporter of the counter-Reformation movement and had the non-Catholic citizens thrown out of Würzburg. Under his reign, the witch trials were resumed and the Jews of Würzburg were expelled and their property was confiscated.</p>

<h2>Bishops will die!</h2>
<p>After a bishop died, his body would be taken to the fortress and an autopsy would be performed to determine the cause of death. His innards would be removed and placed in a tin vessel, which was then buried in the Marienkapelle in the fortress. The heart would be brought to the Cistercian monestary in Ebrach, so that the monastery would not be lost to Bamberg. It was a great honour to safekeep the heart of the bishop. The bishop's body was then washed with wine and filled with fragrant herbs. A wooden stake would be put into the back as the body needed to sit upright for the two day ceremony during which it would be brought from the fortress to the cathedral, where it would be buried. Lastly, a master sculptor would be commissioned to make the grave monument. </p>
