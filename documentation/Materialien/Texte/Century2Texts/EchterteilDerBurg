<h2>Renaissance fortress</h2>
<p>Lorenz of Bibra initiated the Renaissance-style reconstruction of the fortress. Soon after, under the bishop Wirsberg, the south side of the fortress burnt down due to a night candle that he forgot to put out. Julius Echter had the fortress repaired and enhanced, but he made a mistake. He didn't enlarge the walls enough, so the defenders couldn't see the gate. The mechanism of the drawbridge wasn't that good, either: during the Thirty Years' War, the fortress was attacked by the Swedish and the defenders weren't able to pull up the bridge due to the dead bodies on it.</p>
