<h2>first try</h2>
<p>The first attempt to found a university in Würzburg was in 1402. But only few years later, some of the university students murdered the director and it was closed again.</p>

<h2>Echter try</h2>
<p>When Julius Echter founded the university, he had built a separate university building where the students could live and study. Before that, the students had to come to the professors to listen their lectures and had to find a place to sleep and eat, so the Echter university was pretty comfortable place to study.</p>

<h2>Neubaukirche</h2>
<p>The Neubaukirche was built as a part of the university founded by Julius Echter. Its tower is Würzburg's highest, and this is also the place where Echter's heart rests. In the middle ages, the funeral ceremony of the prince bishops contained a ritual in which the heart of the dead bishop is taken out and put into a vessel. The vessel with Echter's heart stands in the tower of the Neubaukirche due to Echters wish, "After my death my heart should be where it has always been!"</p>
