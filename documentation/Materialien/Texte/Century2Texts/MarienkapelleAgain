<h2>Jews</h2>
<p>Before the chapel was built, a Jewish synagogue stood in its place, but when the plague raged through Würzburg, the Jews were driven out and their synagogue was burned down. After the massacre of the Jews, a church was built at the place of the burnt synagogue as atonement, not for massacring the Jews, but for letting Jews into the city.</p>

<h2>Chapel of the citizens</h2>
<p>The Marienkapelle is a chapel built by citizens of Würzburg and was their whole pride, as it was built with their money. To maintain the chapel, shops were opened around it. Over the main entrance the doomsday is depicted, as well as a bishop who is being sent to hell. To excuse this gibe, the citizens claimed that the scene showed that everyone is equal in death.</p>

<h2>The smell of decay</h2>
<p>The chapel got very rich over time. That is due to the possibility for even simple citizens to be buried under the chapel floor. After some time, this became a big problem, because there were not enough floor plates to cover all the bodies and the smell of decay spread through the whole chapel.</p>
