<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>Since the early middle ages, the taxes of Würzburg were brought here, to this wine tavern. That came in pretty handy, because a big part of the taxes were handed over in form of wine, which is not surprising in a big wine region like this. In fact, it was to much wine to store at once, and Würzburg was forced to sell wine, which made the city more prosperous.</p>

<h2>Peasants war</h2>
<p>In times of the peasant revolts, the prince-bishop left the city to avoid the wrath of his people. When a peasant army arrived at the gates, the city council decided to let them in and the leaders of the army gathered in this tavern. When they held meetings, they let a morning star hang out of the window, which was the reason why the tavern was later called Stachel, as this is the Franconian word for morning star.</p>
