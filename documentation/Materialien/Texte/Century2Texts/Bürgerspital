<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Like the Juliusspital, this hospital, the so-called Bürgerspital, was founded to take care of the old and sick, but it was funded by the citizens rather than a privileged person. Formerly the Bürgerspital was a Siechhaus, which is housing for terminally ill people, but after some time, the heavily sick people were sent away.</p>

<h2>Teufel</h2>
<p>Two families in particular stood out in case of the funding of the Bürgerspital: the families Steren and Teufel (which means "devil"). People joked about the name of the last family, "Even the devil does good things in Würzburg."</p>

<h2>Other facts</h2>
<p>The city medicus was responsible for the supplies for the Bürgerspital, what was pretty expensive. Everyone who wanted to stay in the Bürgerspital had to offer all of their possessions to it, but at least they got prescribed one glass of wine per day!</p>
