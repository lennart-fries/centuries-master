<h2>Former times</h2>
<p>When there was no bridge to cross the river, traders and other people had to rely on a ford, which was impassable at
   high tide. At such times there was no easy way over the Main, which was disadvantageous for Würzburg as it was the most
   convenient place to cross the river in the surrounding area. The city lost income due to lower tariffs and cheaper goods
   when no one could cross the Main, so it was decided that Würzburg needed a bridge.</p>

<h2>Bridge times</h2>
<p>Master-builder Enzelin was the one who built the first bridge across the Main. He used the so-called "Enzelin"-bows
   to construct it and nobody thought that the bridge could be stable built with this new technique. But it was, and
   rumors arose that Enzelin had a contract with the devil. Then Enzelin got the offer to do some construction work on
   the cathedral from the bishop himself and those rumors vanished.</p>

<h2>Tricky bridge</h2>
<p>A small part of the bridge wasn't made of stone, but simply of wood. That seems unpractical, but in case of an attack,
   the wooden part of the bridge could be removed so it was impassable. Afterwards, the wooden part could be
   easily replaced.<p>
