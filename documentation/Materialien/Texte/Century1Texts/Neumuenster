<h2>Kilian, Kolonat and Totnan</h2>
<p>Kilian the missionary bishop, together with his helpers, Kolonat and Totnan, tried to convert Würzburg to
Christianity. In the beginning he succeeded: the duke Gospert, who ruled Würzburg at the time, converted. After that
Kilian demanded that Gospert get rid of his wife, Gailana, who had been the former wife of Gospert's dead brother.
Gailana ordered the murder of Kilian and his friends and had them buried in the stables. Fifty years later, these bones
were found by bishop Burkard and the whole story came out.</p>

<h2>Many holy people</h2>
<p>After the bones of Kilian, Kolonat and Totnan were found, they were canonized, not only because of their holy
mission, but also because of their martyr deaths. This made Würzburg the city with the most Saints north of the Alps.</p>

<h2>Relics to feel</h2>
<p>Here in the Neumünster lie the Relics of Kilian, Kolonat and Totnat. The relic coffin is in the crypt, you can open
it to touch them. These old bones are said to be good for the eyes. You can find a magic spring with healing water, too,
which brought a lot of pilgrims to Würzburg in the old times.</p>
