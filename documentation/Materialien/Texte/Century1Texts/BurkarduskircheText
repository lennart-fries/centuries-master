<h2>Burkard</h2>
<p>The Burkarduskirche, or rather "Sankt Burkard", was named after Burkard, the first bishop of Würzburg. Burkhard was an
   Anglosaxon born in the south-west of England who became a monk and started working as a missionary on the mainland. In
   742 it was finally time: Burkard became bishop of Würzburg.</p>

<h2>Holy bones</h2>
<p>After a trip to Rome, bishop Burkard got lucky. Due to some excavations close to Würzburg, the bones of some
   Franconian apostles where found. This increased pilgrim tourism in the following years and made Würzburg rich.</p>

<h2>Andreaskloster</h2>
<p>The origin of this building lies with Burkard, the first bishop of Würzburg. He founded the so-called
   Andreaskloster here, named after the holy Andreas.</p>

<h2>Death</h2>
<p>In 755 Burkard, first bishop of Würzburg, died as a hermit in Homburg am Main. In 988 his bones were brought to the
   Andreaskloster. After that the Andreaskloster was renamed to Sankt Burkard.</p>
