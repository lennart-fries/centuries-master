<h2>Eckhart de Foro</h2>
<p>This building was first owned by Graf Eckhart de Foro, an official and servant of the bishop of Würzburg. In 1201 he was
murdered by Bodo von Ravensburg and Heinrich von Falkenberg. These two noblemen had to pay extra taxes to the bishop,
but did not want to bow to these orders, so they sent the bishop a clear sign by killing his friend. But that was not
enough as they later killed the bishop. In 1316 the city bought this house and made it the city hall.</p>

<h2>Pursuing freedom</h2>
<p>Würzburg tried to gain independence from its prince-bishops for a long time. It seemed that it had achieved it when König
Wenzel der Faule (king Wenzel the idle) promised to the people of Würzburg that they would be a free city of the
Holy Roman Empire. The prince-bishop reversed that the day after it was promised, but nonetheless, the people of
Würzburg tried to free themselves. It would take some time until they gained freedom from the prince-bishops.</p>
