<h2>Ancestors</h2>
<p>The location on top of the Marienberg hill is secure and provides a pretty good view of the surrounding area. That
   was known the Celtic people, who were the first to build a defensive flight castle there. But the Celts were expelled
   by Franks and after some time the Marienkapelle was built on top of the Marienberg. This small chapel had to be defended
   and was soon surrounded by walls made of wood and clay.</p>

<h2>Early state</h2>
<p>In its early state, the castle was surrounded by a 12 meter deep moat. After some time defensive courtyards were added,
   such as the Greiffenclauhof and the Echterhof. A 100-meter deep well was dug to serve as a water source in case of a
   siege.</p>

<h2>Prince-bishops</h2>
<p>When the bishops of Würzburg achieved the status of prince-bishops, they gained the right to rule in secular and
   clerical affairs, which meant firstly the right to raise taxes. Thus, the taxes were increased and the people of
   Würzburg grew angry, which lead to the murder of one of the prince-bishops. His successors stayed in the Marienberg
   Fortress for their own safety.</p>
