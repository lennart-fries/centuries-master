<h2>King family</h2>
<p>The Saliers were a family of royal lineage that built 4 cathedrals in the Holy Roman Empire: one in Worms, one in
M端nster, one in Speyer and one in W端rzburg. A relative of the Saliers called Bruno was bishop of W端rzburg when he
commissioned the creation of the cathedral in W端rzburg. He thought that he would never see the finished cathedral
and he was right.</p>

<h2>Holy Bruno</h2>
<p>At a festivity, the ground beneath the feet of bishop Bruno broke away and he fell unfavourably. He died of a broken
neck. At the place where the relics of bishop Bruno were stored, some people reported cases of wonder healing, so Bruno
was declared holy. That's why he has been revered as a saint since 1200.</p>
