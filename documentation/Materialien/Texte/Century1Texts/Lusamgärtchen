<h2>Walter</h2>
<p>Walter von der Vogelweide was the most important singer in his time. He wrote a lot of romantic songs, but he also
wrote critical and political songs. Due to his bad luck, he had to change his patronage many times, because he always
stood on the wrong side of conflicts. When he was fifty years old, he got a piece of land close to Würzburg from emperor
Friedrich II so he wasn't forced to make music for his money anymore. Soon he started to write praises about emperor
Friedrich II. 10 years later he died in Würzburg and was buried here, in the Lusamgärtchen, but this information is not
confirmed.</p>
